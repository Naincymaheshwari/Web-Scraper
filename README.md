This is our Web Scraper Website.
To run this website, we need to create a virtual environment if it is not created.
By using the command - python -m venv venv
For installing the dependencies please run pip install -r requirements.txt
Then to run the code you can use the command - python main.py
Now, you can visit our website, i.e., Web Scraper website.
After compilation of the code devtools will listen the code and identify the tools it use then it will create a csv file, i.e., verge.csv file which provides us the (id, url, headline, author, date) from "https://www.theverge.com".
